# A Simple Theory of Goal Refinement

Suitable for people who believe stuff and value stuff but haven't found particular directions yet, this minimally interactive workshop aims to amplify your reasoning about what your goals are. Questioning what the mark you'd like to put on the world looks like can be thought of as probing a daunting search space, and I hope to provide some heuristics to make you search more effectively.

In scope: how to convert beliefs and values, once you have them, into goals.
Out of scope: how to believe stuff, how to value stuff, how to find levers, how to win.

Expect to be prompted for mild introspection, to write down your responses, and to have the option of sharing your responses.
