# A simple theory of goal refinement

The following I think I absorbed by osmosis from the community, but may have contributed the consolidation originally.

# Permission
The only premise you are obliged to agree to in order to read this post is that _the world has problems in it_. I don't care about your particular information diet, ideology, aesthetics, priorities, or whatever; I only take issue if you think there's nothing to fix, if you think there's nothing to fix I think there are other posts you can read. 

Please take a moment to think of some problems that you'd like to see fixed. 

By this point, you should be thinking about one or more problems. I hereby **grant you permission to fix them**, by the power invested in me by nothing in particular, you are free from concerns of mandate, job description, qualifications, or jurisdiction. 

Out of scope for this post is **reasoning about competing priorities** i.e. when your candidate goals seem to address too wide a diversity of problems as well as **finding levers, planning, and winning** i.e. what you do once you've defined a goal. 

# The five pieces
There are five things going of
1. beliefs
2. values
3. hubris budget
4. goals
5. filtering: local knowledge, comparative advantage, replaceability analysis

For the mathematically inclined, we can imagine there is some "function" that lands in subsets of goals; one through three are the inputs, four is the output, and five is how you filter your output to just a few goals. 

## 1. beliefs
The important thing to register is that **believing true things is hard** and people, even those who do their best, do not have adequately true beliefs. But where you are in your journey of _approximating_ the truth _with_ your beliefs will be an input to the sorts of goals you identify.

The bedrock of any project is a belief about how the world is. Later, when you're finding levers and planning to win or taking actions, true beliefs will be a boon, factoring out mistakes and inaccuracies. 

## 2. values

It's important to **think clearly about your values**. Pay attention to your gut, but do not worship it as it can mislead or contradict itself. It is worth introspecting, finding the roots of various feelings and inclinations, and consulting the literature. Form your opinions, defend them, hone and practice. 

To be dead simple, we fall back to Hume. Your beliefs are your best guess about what is. Your values are your best guess about what ought to be. 

## 3. hubris budget
Think of hubris as some finite allocation, like an account balance. _Budget_ is a stronger metaphor than _a DnD stat_, because we like to imply that you can spend, save, invest, or even go into debt. 

But what is hubris? I think it has three parts
### Risk tolerance

### Tendency to escape crab buckets
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality): 
> Crab mentality, also known as crab theory, crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket, or pot) mentality, or the crab-bucket effect, is a way of thinking best described by the phrase "if I can't have it, neither can you". 

Apocryphally members of country A have emigrated to country B for reasons of entrepreneurial culture, and reported that in country A if you talk about a world-changing product at a bar people want to knock you down a few pegs, while in country B if you do the same people are more encouraging. We say that country A is in a crab-bucket sort of state, because allegedly when a crab tries to climb out of a bucket the other crabs, for whatever reason, pull it back in. 

This is related to your ability to distinguish _criticism_ from _complaints_. Any ambitious project will come under attack, but whether these attacks are _actionable_ (do they point out fixable problems?) or not is what distinguishes them between criticism and complaint-- some people complain about stuff without there being a path you can take to fix it. 

### Hero license

Hubris budgeting is the part of the process that [hero license](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/heroic-responsibility) factors in. 
#### Conjecture: people who cultivate hero license increase their hubris budget. 
How to cultivate hero license is the subject of another post. 

### Diversity of tactics
From a civilizational perspective, it's clear that we want diversity in hubris budgets. We need people who refuse to spend a lot of hubris or who don't have a lot of hubris to spend to increase the rate of projects which actually get done, to say nothing of socially valuable but not particularly improbable projects. But without people willing to spend a lot of hubris, we [stagnate](https://quinnd.net/blog/elixir/). 

The point for the current post is for you to figure out what role _you_ play and be intentional about it.

## 4. goals

## 5. filtering
The process so far may saddle you with a variety of goals, even a variety of goals surrounding the same basic problem. The last stage in the process is to filter them down. 
### local knowledge

### comparative advantage

It's actually fair to say local knowledge is a kind of comparative advantage. 
### replaceability analysis

# Ok, then what? 

Then you find levers, and win. But that is out of scope for this post, and I doubt I could write about it at such a generic level.
